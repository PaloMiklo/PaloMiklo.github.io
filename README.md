# Personal

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.2 and is a client side application to my personal application. 
I have created it as a fun experimental application where I try out new ideas and technologies time to time in my free time, just for the sake of having fun.
The application built from the latest committed changes is deployed and can be accessed [here](palomiklo.github.io/#/).

## Development server

Take a look at the `package.json` file to find the appropriate command for starting a development server. Once the server is running, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser. If you make any changes to the source files, the application will automatically reload.      

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
